User: How likely is it that {cat_features} are predicted as {class_names}?
Parsed: filter {cat_features} true and likelihood [E]

User: Could you tell me how likely it is that {cat_features} equal to {cat_values} are predicted as {class_names}?
Parsed: filter {cat_features} {cat_values} and likelihood [E]

User: Show the likelihood that {cat_features} and {cat_features} with {num_features} greater than or equal to {num_values} are predicted as {class_names}
Parsed: filter {cat_features} true and filter {cat_features} true and lengthfilter greater equal than {num_values} and likelihood [E]

User: How likely are {cat_features} predicted as {class_names}?
Parsed: filter {cat_features} true and likelihood [E]

User: Please tell me how likely it is that instances that are not {cat_features} get the prediction {class_names}?
Parsed: filter {cat_features} false and likelihood [E]

User: Could you tell me how likely {cat_features} equal to {cat_values} are to be predicted as {class_names}?
Parsed: filter {cat_features} {cat_values} and likelihood [E]
