User: First, show me the predictions on data with more than {num_values} words. Second, tell me why the model predicted them.
Parsed: lengthfilter words greater than {num_values} and predict and important all [E]

User: could you show me data with at least {num_values} words and tell me why the model predicts it?
Parsed: lengthfilter words greater equal than {num_values} and show and important all [E]

User: Initially, show me the data with a length of less than {num_values} words. Second, tell me why the model predicted them.
Parsed: lengthfilter words less than {num_values} and show and important all [E]
