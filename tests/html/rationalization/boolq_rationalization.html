Passage: List of numbers in various languages -- The following tables list the cardinal number names and symbols for the numbers 0 through 10 in various languages and scripts of the world. Where possible, each language's native writing system is used, along with transliterations in Latin script and other important writing systems where applicable. In some languages, numbers will be illustrated through to 20.
<br><b>Explanation:</b> 

The answer to the question is that the number of digits in a number is not the only thing that determines its value. For example, in English, we have the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. The number 10 is the largest number that can be written in the English language. However, it is also the smallest number.
