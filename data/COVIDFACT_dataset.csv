80,Oncogen researchers propose personalized vaccinomics strategy for the novel china coronavirus,SUPPORTED,"The candidate peptides were designed by applying to viral antigens a technology used for personalized vaccination in cancer, based on long neoantigen peptides, currently in clinical trials for cancer therapy. Technical details of the approach used are detailed below: We identified multiepitope peptide vaccine candidates against nCov that can potentially trigger both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immune response. The approach that we used for designing potential peptide vaccine candidates takes a more personalized strategy, referred to as vaccinomics , which enables the selection of target viral proteins with low mutation rates, and the design of peptides tuned to the immune characteristics of the target populations, variable based on geographic location and ethnicity. Based on the human MHC (human leukocyte antigen) allele variation, the peptide vaccines can be made more relevant to a community or individual. The selection of the peptides that could act as vaccines is determined by the binding of the processed viral peptide with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules, and the relevant HLA alleles.",https://oncogen.ro/category/oncogen-researchers/

121,Mice trace severe covid-19 to faulty genes and autoimmune condition,REFUTED,"These findings provide compelling evidence that the disruption of type I interferon is often the cause of life-threatening COVID-19, says Jean-Laurent Casanova, head of the St. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases at The Rockefeller University and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. COVID-19 may now be the best understood acute infectious disease in terms of having a molecular and genetic explanation for nearly 15 percent of critical cases across diverse ancestries, Casanova says. Genetics of COVID-19 outliers The way SARS-CoV-2 affects people differently has been puzzling. Science Inborn errors of type I IFN immunity in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 Zhang Q. et al. Whether the proteins have been neutralized by so-called auto- antibodies, or were not produced in sufficient amounts in the first place due to a faulty gene, their missing-in-action appears to be a common theme among a subgroup of COVID-19 sufferers whose disease has thus far been a mystery.",https://www.rockefeller.edu/news/29183-severe-covid-19-faulty-genes-autoimmune-condition/

368,Coronavirus vaccines work through safety trials,REFUTED,"Vaccines expose the immune system to components of a virus  the coronavirus spike protein, in the case of nearly all COVID-19 vaccines  in the hope of teaching it how to react against a real infection in the future. In the past few days, scientists working at feverish pace to develop vaccines against the coronavirus have released a flood of data from their first human trials. The vaccine is inducing the kind of immune responses that we think are inducing protection against coronavirus, said Sarah Gilbert, a vaccinologist co-leading the Oxford effort, in a press briefing announcing the results. But they suggest that the candidate vaccines are broadly safe, and offer the first hints that vaccines can summon immune responses similar to those of people who have been infected with the virus. Its definitely plausible that theres more than one way to protect against this virus. The nature of the immune response that protects  or fails to protect  against COVID-19 will become clearer when efficacy trials deliver their first results.",https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02174-y?utm_source=twt_nnc&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=naturenews

A recent paper, that appeared as a preprint on the bioRxiv server in January 2021, shows the effectiveness of a novel recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses modified SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen, in preventing the replication of the virus in the respiratory tract of transgenic mice, and to prevent lethal disease. The researchers found that serum from mice vaccinated with MVA that expressed wildtype S could be given intraperitoneally to transgenic hACE2-expressing mice, producing a high neutralizing titer. Weight loss and lethality following intranasal infection of transgenic hACE2 mice with CoV-2 was prevented by one or two immunizations with rMVAs or by passive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.30.424878v1

Moreover, MIS-C patients had reduced neutralizing activity compared to both COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response. Here, we show distinct antibody (Ab) responses in children with MIS-C compared to adults with severe COVID-19 causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and those who recovered from mild disease. There was a reduced breadth and specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in MIS-C patients compared to the COVID patient groups; MIS-C predominantly generated IgG Abs specific for the Spike (S) protein but not for the nucleocapsid (N) protein, while the COVID-19 cohorts had anti-S IgG, IgM and IgA Abs, as well as anti-N IgG Abs.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.20151068v1

Aug 11 2020 Teenagers and young adults who vape face a much higher risk of COVID-19 than their peers who do not vape, a new study has found.",https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/08/vaping-linked-to-covid-19-risk-in-teens-and-young-adults.html

Nevertheless, this survey of gut microbiota alterations in association with immune dysregulation revealed that gut microorganisms are likely involved in the modulation of host inflammatory responses in COVID-19.

2755,Antibody cocktail to sars-cov-2 spike protein prevents rapid mutational escape seen with individual antibodies,SUPPORTED,"The prospective goal of generating this very large collection was to select pairs of highly potent individual antibodies that could simultaneously bind the RBD spike, and thus might be ideal partners for a therapeutic antibody cocktail that not only could be an effective treatment, but might also protect against antibody resistance resulting from virus escape mutants that could arise in response to selective pressure from single-antibody treatments. Our data strongly support the notion that cocktail therapy may provide a powerful way to minimize mutational escape by SARS-CoV-2; in particular, our studies point to the potential value of antibody cocktails in which two antibodies were chosen so as to bind to distinct and non-overlapping regions of the viral target (in this case, the RBD of the spike protein), and thus require the unlikely occurrence of simultaneous mutations at two distinct genetic sites for viral escape. To functionally confirm that the spike protein mutations detected by sequencing are responsible for the loss of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by the antibodies, we generated VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudoparticles expressing the individual identified spike mutations. For an antibody cocktail in which the components demonstrate complete competition (REGN10989+REGN10934), a single amino acid substitution was sufficient to ablate neutralization of the cocktail; hence, both of these antibodies require binding to the Glu484 residue in order to neutralize SARS-CoV-2.",https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/06/15/science.abd0831

In November 2018, NIH inquired of Harvard whether Lieber had failed to disclose his then-suspected relationship with WUT and Chinas Thousand Talents Plan. Lieber caused Harvard to falsely tell NIH that Lieber had no formal association with WUT after 2012, that WUT continued to falsely exaggerate his involvement with WUT in subsequent years, and that Lieber is not and has never been a participant in Chinas Thousand Talents Plan.

The use of moderate to high effective filtration efficiency masks by all individuals present, on the other hand, was able to significantly reduce infection probability and could achieve reductions in infection probability by 5x, 10x, or even > 100x dependent on the mask used and use of a mask fitter.
