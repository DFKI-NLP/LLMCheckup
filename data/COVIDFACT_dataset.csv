80,Oncogen researchers propose personalized vaccinomics strategy for the novel china coronavirus,0,"The candidate peptides were designed by applying to viral antigens a technology used for personalized vaccination in cancer, based on long neoantigen peptides, currently in clinical trials for cancer therapy. Technical details of the approach used are detailed below: We identified multiepitope peptide vaccine candidates against nCov that can potentially trigger both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immune response. The approach that we used for designing potential peptide vaccine candidates takes a more personalized strategy, referred to as vaccinomics , which enables the selection of target viral proteins with low mutation rates, and the design of peptides tuned to the immune characteristics of the target populations, variable based on geographic location and ethnicity. Based on the human MHC (human leukocyte antigen) allele variation, the peptide vaccines can be made more relevant to a community or individual. The selection of the peptides that could act as vaccines is determined by the binding of the processed viral peptide with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules, and the relevant HLA alleles.",https://oncogen.ro/category/oncogen-researchers/

One promising candidate is remdesivir, a drug originally developed for Ebola.",https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/repurposing-existing-drugs-for-covid-19-a-more-rapid-alternative-to-a-vaccine-say-researchers

S2) showed that remdesivir also inhibited virus infection efficiently in a human cell line (human liver cancer Huh-7 cells), which is sensitive to 2019-nCoV.2 Chloroquine, a widely-used anti-malarial and autoimmune disease drug, has recently been reported as a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug.8,9 Chloroquine is known to block virus infection by increasing endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion, as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV.10 Our time-of-addition assay demonstrated that chloroquine functioned at both entry, and at post-entry stages of the 2019-nCoV infection in Vero E6 cells (Fig. Notably, two compounds remdesivir (EC50 = 0.77 μM; CC50 > 100 μM; SI > 129.87) and chloroquine (EC50 = 1.13 μM; CC50 > 100 μM, SI > 88.50) potently blocked virus infection at low-micromolar concentration and showed high SI (Fig.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0282-0?fbclid=IwAR1DeWaS1w2LD3MrW

An autopsy of a patient with COVID-19 and ARDS who died of a sudden cardiac arrest showed no evidence of myocardial structural involvement, suggesting that COVID-19 did not directly impair the heart57.

The authorization set off a complicated coordination effort from Pfizer, private shipping companies, state and local health officials, the military, hospitals and pharmacy chains to get the first weeks batch of about three million doses to health care workers and nursing home residents as quickly as possible, all while keeping the vaccine at ultracold temperatures. McKesson Corporation, a giant medical supplier, is sending kits of syringes, alcohol pads, face shields and other supplies to the same sites, where they will meet up with the vaccines that Pfizer is shipping in special boxes, packed with dry ice, designed to keep them at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/health/pfizer-vaccine-authorized.html?referringSource=articleShare

2755,Antibody cocktail to sars-cov-2 spike protein prevents rapid mutational escape seen with individual antibodies,0,"The prospective goal of generating this very large collection was to select pairs of highly potent individual antibodies that could simultaneously bind the RBD spike, and thus might be ideal partners for a therapeutic antibody cocktail that not only could be an effective treatment, but might also protect against antibody resistance resulting from virus escape mutants that could arise in response to selective pressure from single-antibody treatments. Our data strongly support the notion that cocktail therapy may provide a powerful way to minimize mutational escape by SARS-CoV-2; in particular, our studies point to the potential value of antibody cocktails in which two antibodies were chosen so as to bind to distinct and non-overlapping regions of the viral target (in this case, the RBD of the spike protein), and thus require the unlikely occurrence of simultaneous mutations at two distinct genetic sites for viral escape. To functionally confirm that the spike protein mutations detected by sequencing are responsible for the loss of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by the antibodies, we generated VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudoparticles expressing the individual identified spike mutations. For an antibody cocktail in which the components demonstrate complete competition (REGN10989+REGN10934), a single amino acid substitution was sufficient to ablate neutralization of the cocktail; hence, both of these antibodies require binding to the Glu484 residue in order to neutralize SARS-CoV-2.",https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/06/15/science.abd0831

Although this study can not be conclusive, we believe that the evidence presented here is strongly consistent with the notion that the biased geographic distribution of SARS- CoV-2 isolates should not be associated with adaptive evolution of this novel pathogen. Here, we analyze more than 1100 complete, high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and provide evidence for the absence of distinct evolutionary patterns/signatures in the genomes of the currently known major clades of SARS-CoV-2. We observe that while cross species adaptation of the virus is associated with hypervariability of specific protein coding regions (including the RDB domain of the spike protein), the more variable genomic regions between extant SARS- CoV-2 episomes correspond with the 3 and 5 UTRs, suggesting that at present viral protein coding genes should not be subjected to different adaptive evolutionary pressures in different viral strains.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.016790v1

4061,Ema endorses use of dexamethasone in covid-19 patients on oxygen or mechanical ventilation,0,"Dexamethasone was first considered a potential treatment for COVID-19 because of its ability to reduce inflammation, which plays an important role in the disease process in some patients who have been admitted to hospital with COVID-19. In patients receiving oxygen without mechanical ventilation, the figures were 23% with dexamethasone and 26% with usual care, with a relative reduction of about 20%. Dexamethasone can be taken by mouth or given as an injection or infusion (drip) into a vein. Based on the review of available data, EMA is endorsing the use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents (from 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg) who require supplemental oxygen therapy. The CHMPs scientific opinion can be taken into account by EU member states and EMA when evaluating dexamethasone medicines for the treatment of COVID-19.",https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-endorses-use-dexamethasone-covid-19-patients-oxygen-mechanical-ventilation
