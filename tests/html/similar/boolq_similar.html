It is and imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property as per 1978, 44th amendment of constitution). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from the excise-type UK rate. The tax power is vested in the states and is delegated to local bodies, specifying the valuation method, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied and other properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Vacant land is generally exempt. Central government properties are exempt. Instead a 'service charge' is permissible under executive order. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity. The tax is usually accompanied by service taxes, e.g., water tax, drainage tax, conservancy (sanitation) tax, lighting tax, all using the same tax base. The rate structure is flat on rural (panchayat) properties, but in the urban (municipal) areas it is mildly progressive with about 80% of assessments falling in the first two brackets.</details><br>Here are some instances similar to <b>id 1</b>:<br><b> id 2443</b> (cossim 0.745):  <summary>is land tax the same as property tax Property tax -- A property tax or millage...</summary><details>is land tax the same as property tax Property tax -- A property tax or millage rate is an ad valorem tax on the value of a property, usually levied on real estate.

This can be a national government, a federated state, a county or geographical region or a municipality. Multiple jurisdictions may tax the same property. This tax can be contrasted to a rent tax which is based on rental income or imputed rent, and a land value tax, which is a levy on the value of land, excluding the value of buildings and other improvements.</details><br><b> id 2920</b> (cossim 0.626):  <summary>is property tax the same as council tax Property tax -- In the UK the ownership...</summary><details>is property tax the same as council tax Property tax -- In the UK the ownership of residential property or land is not taxed, a situation almost unique in the OECD.
